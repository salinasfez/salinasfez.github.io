Poke Battle was created using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and JQUERY.

Instructions: 

Click on the 'Poke Start' button to activate the game!
Click the 'Attack' button to attack your enemy, once you attack the enemy gets to retalite so be alert!
Click on the 'Defend' button to defend yourself against enemy attacks.
Resort to the 'Reset' button any time to reset the game and start all over again. 

Logic: 

Attack and get attacked one click at a time. There is a total of 4 enemies you must defeat before your health drops to zero! If you can manage to get all of the enemy's healths down to zero (eliminatin them), YOU WIN!

Current unsolved problems:

I am having major trouble making everything work on the DOM. As of right now, I can only attack but can not be attacked.
